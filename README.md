# unibo-info
This folder contains some codes I have written during Python classes at university.
The lessons at university were basically focused on learning how to program (from scratch until creating new Classes) using Thonny (including how to use debug), Python Tutor and Python documentation. Most given exercises were focused on solving math problems. Nothing about Git/GitHub was taught during this course.

I'm also developing my Python skills on Udemy. I will create a new folder to commit the projects I will need to develop during the Udemy course.
