This file contains some of the exercises I have developed during my Python classes at University.
The lessons were more focused on learning how to program and solve math problems using a simple Python tool called Thonny. Nothing about Git/GitHub
where taught.
I'm also learning Python at Udemy and I will create a new file to commit the projects I will develop.
